I created a Calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 🖥️🔢 It was a fun and rewarding challenge to implement all the logic, making it fully functional and interactive. The calculator now does basic arithmetic like ➕ addition, ➖ subtraction, ✖️ multiplication, and ➗ division, all in a clean and user-friendly design! 💡
